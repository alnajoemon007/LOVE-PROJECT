💖 Love Connect – Valentine’s Day Compatibility Checker

🌸 Overview

Love Connect is a Valentine’s Day-themed web application that calculates compatibility between two individuals using their names and zodiac signs.

Inspired by the nostalgic “love percentage” games we used to play during childhood, this project transforms that fun concept into a modern, interactive web experience built using front-end technologies.

The application generates:
	•	❤️ A compatibility percentage
	•	💞 A relationship status (Perfect Match, Great Friends, Soulmates, etc.)
	•	🔮 A zodiac-based compatibility bonus
🎯 Features
	•	🔤 Name-based compatibility calculation
	•	♈ Zodiac sign matching logic
	•	📊 Dynamic percentage generation
	•	💬 Custom relationship result messages
	•	🎨 Attractive Valentine-themed UI
	•	⚡ Instant results without page reload
🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	HTML5 – Structure
	•	CSS3 – Styling and layout
	•	JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – Logic & compatibility algorithm
	•	Git & GitHub – Version control and project hosting
🧠 How It Works
	1.	User enters two names.
	2.	User selects both zodiac signs.
	3.	The system:
	•	Calculates a base compatibility score using name logic.
	•	Applies zodiac compatibility bonus if signs match predefined good pairs.
	4.	A final percentage is generated.
	5.	A relationship message is displayed based on the score range.
🎉 Inspiration

This project is inspired by classic notebook and magazine love-percentage games played during school days. It recreates that playful experience as a structured web application while applying programming logic and UI design principles.
📌 Purpose of the Project
	•	Practice JavaScript logic building
	•	Implement condition-based matching algorithms
	•	Strengthen front-end development skills
	•	Participate in a Valentine’s-themed hackathon
	•	Showcase project deployment and version control using GitHub
